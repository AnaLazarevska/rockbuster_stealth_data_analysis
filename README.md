# rockbuster_stealth_data_analysis
SQL code, Tableau visualisations, and PowerPoint presentation for a data analysis project that supports Rockbuster Stealth's transition from physical stores to an online video rental service.

## Project Overview
This data analysis project was undertaken as part of the Data Analytics course at Career Foundry. It focuses on supporting Rockbuster Stealth, a fictional movie rental company, as they transition from a physical store-based model to an online video rental service.

The project was commissioned by Rockbuster Stealth's Business Intelligence (BI) department to provide data-driven insights that would inform their launch strategy for the new online platform.

The analysis utilizes SQL for data querying and manipulation, and Tableau for creating interactive visualizations to communicate key findings effectively.

## Business Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
- What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
- Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
- Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
- Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data Overview 
This project utilizes a fictional dataset to demonstrate data analysis techniques without involving any actual personal information.
